                    Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Elhoussaine, a <motion.span
                    className="inline-block bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg px-3 py-1 font-semibold text-neutral-900 dark:text-white"

                >Frontend Developer</motion.span> who loves building websites and web applications. I specialize in React.js and Next.js,
                    turning designs into smooth, responsive websites that people enjoy using.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What I do best is create beautiful user interfaces. I&apos;m really good at taking a design and bringing it to life
                    exactly as envisioned, making sure it works perfectly on all devices. While I&apos;m mainly focused on frontend development,
                    I also enjoy building <motion.span
                    className="inline-block bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg px-3 py-1 font-semibold text-neutral-900 dark:text-white"
                    whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
                    transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
                >Full-Stack applications</motion.span> using Next.js when projects need both frontend and backend work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I&apos;ve worked with various companies and startups, helping them create great web experiences. I use modern tools
                    like Redux Toolkit and Tailwind CSS to build efficient, user-friendly applications. What makes me different is my
                    attention to detail and focus on quality â€“ I believe that small details make a big difference in how people experience
                    a website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I&apos;m passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with new technologies, always looking for better ways to solve
                    problems and create amazing web experiences.
