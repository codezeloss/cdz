                    Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Elhoussaine, a <motion.span
                    className="inline-block bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg px-3 py-1 font-semibold text-neutral-900 dark:text-white"

                    a strong focus on building production-ready digital solutions using the <strong>Next.js
                    ecosystem</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I specialize in <strong>frontend development</strong> with React.js and Tailwind CSS, and I also handle
                    full-stack application development â€” from building intuitive interfaces to designing performant
                    backend APIs. My strength lies in turning ideas into fast, responsive, and reliable web apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve worked with startups and tech teams to deliver scalable solutions, including internal tools and
                    early-stage SaaS platforms. I take pride in writing clean code, building accessible UI, and focusing
                    on performance, UX, and real-world business impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I regularly use modern tools like <strong>Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, React Query, Redux Toolkit, and AI-powered
                    APIs</strong> to accelerate development and deliver value quickly. I also enjoy leveraging AI tools
                    during the development process to ship faster and smarter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether it&apos;s a sleek marketing site, a custom dashboard, or a full-stack SaaS MVP â€” I love building
                    products that users enjoy and businesses rely on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Always learning, always building â€” I&apos;m currently deepening my experience in <strong>AI integration
                    and scalable architecture</strong> to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech world.
                </p>
